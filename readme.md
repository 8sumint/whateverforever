### stupid archive thing
yt-dlps a thing into a folder when requested. in the future could do more types of thing idk

you'll have to customize it for your use.

tips for having a thing that downloads youtube videos for a long time especially unattended: 
probably make a cronjob or something to "pip install -U yt-dlp"

see bookmarklet.html.. i have that set to keyword "ar" so i can "ctrl+L ar" real fast
